- [ ] How the Z gate works
- [ ] The H-Z-H pattern
- [ ] What problem Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm solves
- [ ] How Deutsch-Jozsa is faster than classical computers

# PART 1: QUANTUM INTERFERENCE

## What is Quantum Interference?

**In my own words:**

[Quantum interference is when the waves cancel each other out due to adding waves or through the z gate]

---

## The Z Gate

**What does the Z gate do?**

[The Z Gate is when the 0 stays a 0 and the 1 changes to a -1 but the negative doesnt mean the number itself is changing it only flips creating a wave] 

**Draw or describe the effect:**

|0⟩ → _0______________

|1⟩ → -1_______________

---

## The H-Z-H Pattern

**Step 1: First H gate does...**

[The first H gate put it into superposition and basically saying that the result can either be 0 or 1]

**Step 2: Z gate does...**

[The Z gate flips the number one and turned it into -1 so you can tell if the outcome is balanced or all the same outcome]

**Step 3: Second H gate does...**

[The second H gate figures out if the results cancel each other out or not]

**The result is:**

[Your explanation]

--- basically its giving you a final answer or solution to the problem

## Why Does This Matter?
this matters because youll get your solution and youll know the process and how quantum came up with it.

**How is interference used in quantum algorithms?**

[interference is basically the way to make certain parts stand out like how the Z gate flipes the ones.]

**Something that clicked for me about interference:**

[something that instantly made sense was how the Z gate]

# PART 2: DEUTSCH-JOZSA ALGORITHM

## The Problem It Solves

**What is the mystery box problem?**

[Explain in your own words: What is constant vs balanced?]

**Constant function means:**

[Constant meaning the results are the same multiple times]

**Balanced function means:**

[balanced is when the outcome is more than one variable]
